Bielsa would say it’s because <em>the weak can defeat the powerful</em>. While watching a Rugby match, my friends would say that it’s because <em>football rules are very simple and easy to understand</em>. “El Diego” would say it’s because <em>life goes away</em>.</p><p>Whatever your favorite reason is, there’s always be a collective element in the game. Football is a collective sport and it requires a collective construction.</p><p>As a football enthusiast, such collective construction requires a common ground. If there is no consensus, conflict or frustration are the usual outcomes.</p><h1 id="its-about-values">It’s about values<a class="anchor d-print-none" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fas fa-anchor"></i></a></h1><p>By common ground, I mean a set of values. These may be obvious or just ‘common sense’ but after many ‘after game’ conversations I found that the lack of consensus is very common among teams. For that reason, I think it is important to write them down and talk about them. If we are playing together, and I hope we do, these are the ones I believe in. If you don’t agree with them, it’s fine, let’s talk about it and find new common ground.</p><p>This is my list. They’re just four:</p><ol><li>Team must be inclusive</li><li>Don’t believe in good or bad, believe in growth</li><li>Mistakes are allowed</li><li>Play to win</li></ol><h2 id="1-a-team-must-be-inclusive">1. A team must be inclusive<a class="anchor d-print-none" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fas fa-anchor"></i></a></h2><p>Assuming that</p><ul><li>#1: A football team needs at least eleven, seven, or five players on the field and,</li><li>#2: Every team has players with different levels.</li></ul><p>It simply does not make sense not to be inclusive. It’s a practical thing. Let me show the point with a few examples:</p><p>Let’s say Team A from Hypergalactic Empire Club is lucky enough to gather 15 young and very talented players to play in the <em>Earth Gravity League</em> of Mars Amateur Football Association. Because this is a team just for stars, they exclude five players that want to join the team but they’re not good enough.</p><p>Season stars, Team A wins five matches in a row by at least a ten goals of difference until injuries become a serious thing. So, by the sixth match, the team plays without substitution at all. It’s still a win but because of a new injury in the match, Team A has to play most of the game with ten players. Before the seventh match, two players, who are brothers, decide to take a job in Jupiter and now, Hypergalactic Empire Club’s Team A has to default games.</p><p>Another example, it is common that junior leagues use five aside for a certain age, two years later, they use seven aside and later on nine aside, etc. Similar situation, if you stream <em>more gifted</em> players from the first year, you may experience similar problems as Hypergalactic Club has when the children grow and teams need two more players.</p><p>In a sentence, I believe that football must be inclusive because a team cannot afford the luxury of excluding people.</p><p>Of course, I believe being inclusive is the right thing to do but my point is that even from a pragmatic point of view it doesn’t make sense not to be.</p><h2 id="2-dont-believe-in-good-or-bad-believe-in-growth">2. Don’t believe in good or bad, believe in growth<a class="anchor d-print-none" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fas fa-anchor"></i></a></h2><p>A professional team needs good and very talented players to win the Champions. If a coach doesn’t win matches, the coach will be sacked. Then winning is a must. The job of a lot of people depends on it.</p><p>Amateur football is different. At least, in theory, nobody will be fired if a team doesn’t win. It may not be fun and you may lose players if you don’t win <strong>but</strong> if there’s growth you may not win today but eventually, you will and the best thing, the team will hold together even with bad scores.</p><p>Growth is a mindset. It’s about believing that anyone can improve. Bad or good is a mindset too, it’s called the <em>fixed mindset</em>, you are either good or bad. In the fixed mindset, imperfections are shameful. The growth mindset says all of these things can be developed. All — you, teammates — are capable of growth and change.</p><figure><figure class="post__image post__image--center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://en.allende.nz/football/media/posts/1/mindset-2.jpg" alt="" width="2461" height="2182" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://en.allende.nz/football/media/posts/1/responsive/mindset-2-xs.jpg 300w, https://en.allende.nz/football/media/posts/1/responsive/mindset-2-sm.jpg 480w, https://en.allende.nz/football/media/posts/1/responsive/mindset-2-md.jpg 768w, https://en.allende.nz/football/media/posts/1/responsive/mindset-2-lg.jpg 1024w, https://en.allende.nz/football/media/posts/1/responsive/mindset-2-xl.jpg 1360w, https://en.allende.nz/football/media/posts/1/responsive/mindset-2-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure><figcaption><p><em>Change your mindset poster from Brooklyn Primary School in Wellington, NZ</em></p></figcaption></figure><p> </p><p>The mindset concept is not something new and there are plenty of people who researched and wrote about this topic. Just to mention one, <a href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">Maria Popova’s brainpickings</a> is a very quick introduction to the topic.</p><h2 id="3-mistakes-are-allowed">3. Mistakes are allowed<a class="anchor d-print-none" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fas fa-anchor"></i></a></h2><p>If you believe in growth, mistakes must be allowed. A mistake is a great teacher. Sometimes is the only way to learn.</p><h2 id="4-play-to-win">4. Play to win<a class="anchor d-print-none" aria-hidden="true"><i class="fas fa-anchor"></i></a></h2><p>In a sports game, the participant must stretch his/her skills to meet the challenge provided by the skills of the opponent. The roots of the word “compete” are the Latin <em>con petire</em>, which meant <em>to seek together.</em> What each person seeks is to actualize his/her potential.</p><p>Leaving the outcome aside means quitting the adventure to seek individual and collective potential.</p><p>I’ve met coaches, especially in the junior space, that <em>hide</em> the score from children because they don’t want to expose them to <em>toxic</em> situations. I agree that if players are not concerned about the score it doesn’t make sense to push them, but if they are aware, I think it is essential to take it as part of the game. Outcomes are a useful learning tool. It gives purpose to the game. It creates a sense of urgency. It helps to learn how to deal with frustration. It helps players and coaches to be better and push boundaries.</p><p>And lastly, it creates situations where we may make mistakes and if we do, we learn.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://en.allende.nz/football/media/posts/1/Screenshot-2024-04-14-at-15.03.00.png" alt="" width="1714" height="430" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://en.allende.nz/football/media/posts/1/responsive/Screenshot-2024-04-14-at-15.03.00-xs.png 300w, https://en.allende.nz/football/media/posts/1/responsive/Screenshot-2024-04-14-at-15.03.00-sm.png 480w, https://en.allende.nz/football/media/posts/1/responsive/Screenshot-2024-04-14-at-15.03.00-md.png 768w, https://en.allende.nz/football/media/posts/1/responsive/Screenshot-2024-04-14-at-15.03.00-lg.png 1024w, https://en.allende.nz/football/media/posts/1/responsive/Screenshot-2024-04-14-at-15.03.00-xl.png 1360w, https://en.allende.nz/football/media/posts/1/responsive/Screenshot-2024-04-14-at-15.03.00-2xl.png 1600w"></figure></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://en.allende.nz/football/tags/team-building/">Team Building</a></li><li><a href="https://en.allende.nz/football/tags/values/">Values</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://en.allende.nz/football/authors/roberto-allende/" rel="author">Roberto Allende</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Player and captain of<span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit;"> </span><a href="http://www.wellingtonunited.org.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; border-bottom: 3px solid rgba(var(--yellow), 1); background: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.2);">Wellington United</a><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit;">'s</span><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit;"> master team, </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/WellingtonUnitedLosPiratas" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; border-bottom: 3px solid rgba(var(--yellow), 1);">Los Piratas</a><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit;">.</span><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit;"><br></span><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit;">Junior coach at </span><a href="https://www.bnujfc.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; border-bottom: 3px solid rgba(var(--yellow), 1); background: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.2);">Brooklyn Northern United Junior Football Club</a><span style="color: var(--text-primary-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit;"> in Wellington, New Zealand.</span></p></div></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://en.allende.nz/football/expectations-for-a-junior-football-journey/" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Expectations for a Junior Football Journey </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://en.allende.nz/football/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2024-04-14T17:33" class="feed__date">April 14, 2024</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://en.allende.nz/football/overcoming-adversity-in-football/">Adversity in Football and in Life</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-06-04T17:00" class="feed__date">June 4, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://en.allende.nz/football/beyond-the-joystick-empowering-players-autonomy-and-creativity-in-football/">Beyond the Joystick.
